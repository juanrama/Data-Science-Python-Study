# My Learning Journal on Python for Data Science

Hello, this repository is my learning journal in Python for data science. I have been studying this for a long time, but I have just recently added it to my GitHub.

In this study, I have learned about the following topics:

1. Data Manipulation with NumPy and Pandas
2. Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
3. Basic Understanding of Statistics
4. Machine Learning
5. Data Processing and Preprocessing
6. Model Evaluation and Cross-Validation
